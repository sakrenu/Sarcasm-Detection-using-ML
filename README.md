 Machine learning  techniques for studying the evolution of language  concerning criminal behavior, focusing particularly on data  sourced from online forums.


Online platforms
which are used by people of all age groups especially youth 
have unfortunately become breeding grounds for various 
forms of racist behavior, both overt and covert, significantly 
influencing socio-political dynamics on a global scale.
Moreover, the algorithms and policies implemented by these 
platforms occasionally inadvertently perpetuate 
discrimination. Few real life examples include â€“
- Snapchat and Instagram faced criticism for filters 
promoting "digital blackface" and lightening the skin tone of 
non-white users.
- Facebook's tracking of user activity allowed marketers to 
exclude individuals with specific ethnic affinities, such as 
African American or Hispanic.
- TikTok received backlash for suspending a viral video 
shedding light on China's persecution of Uighurs.
With the current advancements in NLP , it is extremely useful 
to use the techniques of AI to perform the above task in 
detecting any form of cyber bullying on the internet and 
social media. The NLP algorithms can understand the 
linguistic and contextual meaning of the text, find patterns , 
easily and most importantly these models can automate the 
process of pinpointing the bully messages ,flagging abusive 
content etc which can protect the users.
